Spam-resistant comments

### About

noty stores messages in a decentralized ledger and requires a small payment in crypto-currency to prevent spam. Users send small amounts of funds to content creators, in exchange the user is authorized to post a comment. 

The result is a reduction in spam, engaged users, and thoughtful conversation from those who have gained some value from the content and are eager to contribute by adding their two cents.

### Implementation

Currently, noty uses the Florincoin blockchain to store messages. Florincoin is a Litecoin based crypto-currency specifically designed for messaging and data storage.
